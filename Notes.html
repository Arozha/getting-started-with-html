<h1>Important HTML Concepts</h1>
<h3>How the Web Works</h3>
<p>The Internet is a <em><b>large</b></em> collection of networks of computers. When you go to <a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a> in your browser, your computer first sends out a request to find the <b>IP address</b> of the name you typed in. This is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> (<em>Domain Name System</em>) request. Every computer has a default DNS server they can send the request to. After receiving the reply from the DNS server, your computer finally is ready to send an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> request.</p>
<p><b>HTTP</b> (<em>HyperText Transfer Protocol</em>) is the protocol used to display web pages in browsers. Your computer sends the request to its <b>default gateway</b> (typically your home router). Then the gateway forwards the request to your internet provider and after a number of hops through different routers, the HTTP request makes it to the web server, which sends data back through to your computer. That sure sounds like <em><b>a lot</b></em> of traveling to do! Luckily, with fiber-optic cabling and ultra-fast servers, this whole process only takes a few seconds.</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>  
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. Every time you visit a web site, you're seeing HTML as it is interpreted by your browser. HTML documents contain two types of content: text content - <em>which is what you see</em> - and markup - which determines how the text content is <em>organized</em> and <em>styled</em>.</p>  

<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents. Browsers differentiate between elements by using tags. Tags surround text to create elements. Most elements need opening and closing tags, however, some, called <b>void</b> tags, don't have any text at all.</p>

<h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
<p>Inline elements are those HTML elements that are "on the line". They have no additional spacing. &ltspan&gt and &ltbr&gt are examples of inline elements. Block elements have a height and width of space around their content. &ltdiv&gt and &ltp&gt are examples of block elements.</p>

<h3>Computers are Stupid</h3>
<p>Computers only understand <em><b>clear</b></em>, <em><b>unambiguous</b></em> instructions. They also interpret them literally and cannot infer things that we humans can. For example, if you were to tell a computer how to drive, everything would have to be explained. Left, right, forwards, and backwards would be meaningless to a computer unless clearly defined by a programmer. Things that are simple to us are actually very difficult when we think about the algorithms necessary to relate them to machines.</p>
